## Features

- Control the volume of Apple Music, Spotify, and Doppler using the `volume up` and `volume down` keys.
- Especially useful when using AirPlay devices or external speakers.
- Customize the volume step size.
- Option to hide the volume bezel overlay (HUD).
- When Music or Spotify is playing, volume keys affect their volume; otherwise, they adjust system volume.
- Holding `âŒ˜` (Command) key inverts this behavior.
- Toggle behavior with the "Use âŒ˜ modifier" option.

---

## Why Use This App?

- macOS does **not** allow controlling Apple Music's volume via keyboard keys â€” only the system volume.
- AirPlay speakers depend on **app-specific** volume, not system volume.
- This app restores fine-grained volume control directly from your keyboard.
- Avoid the intrusive volume HUD overlay when watching movies.
- Works seamlessly with Spotify and Doppler, too.

## Installation

1. **Download** the [latest notarized release](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alberti42/Volume-Control/main/VolumeControl.zip).
2. **Unzip** the archive.
3. **Drag** the app into your `Applications` folder (or anywhere you like).
4. **Launch** the app.

Thatâ€™s it â€” no extra Terminal commands or security tweaks are required. ðŸŽ‰

## Permissions

The app requires Accessibility and Automation permissions to control other apps' volumes.

1. When prompted, allow access to control **Music** and **Spotify**.
2. If you missed it or need to reset:
   - Go to **System Settings â†’ Privacy & Security â†’ Accessibility**
   - Remove and re-add _Volume Control_.
   - Also check **Automation** and ensure both Music and Spotify are enabled.
